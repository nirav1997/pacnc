<b>Prevention Against Coronavirus - North Carolina</b>

This repository is part of our group's submission for [HackNC 2020](https://www.hacknc.com/).

The purpose of this project is to help fight the surge of cases of COVID-19. By using this application, people can help reduce their possible exposure to the virus. By inputting a list of possible locations they need to visit, the application will not just give them a probability of their risk of exposure to the virus but also suggest some alternative route arrangements with even less exposure.

## Use of Technology
- Django
- Google Maps Places API
- Google Cloud Platform
- PostgreSQL
- Dialogflow

## Further Improvements
- Add functionalities that allow users to view live crowdsourced data to predict the number of people present at a particular place. 
- Allow users to anonymously share their positive COVID report in order to find a network of people they last interacted with and send them warnings to self-quarantine.
- Suggest remedies to prevent coronavirus.
